# NAME: Cluster's name.
# c_x: Cluster's x center coordinate.
# c_y: Cluster's y center coordinate.
# r_cl: Cluster's radius.
# e_rcl: Cluster's radius error.
# r_c: Core radius (3-P King profile).
# e_rc: Core radius error.
# r_t: Tidal radius (3-P King profile).
# e_rt: Tidal radius error.
# kcp: King's profile concentration parameter.
#
# CI: 'Contamination index' is a  measure of the contamination of field
#      stars in the cluster region. The closer to 1, the more contaminated 
#      the cluster region is.
# n_memb_k: Approximate number of cluster's members obtained integrating the
#         fitted 3-P King profile (if it converged).
# n_memb: Approximate number of cluster's members assuming a uniform
#       background.
# n_memb_da: Approximate number of cluster's members obtained via the DA
#          algorithm.
# memb_par: Members parameter comparing the approximate structural number of
#           members ('n_memb') with the approximate photometric number of
#           members ('n_memb_da').
# a_f: Fraction of cluster's area that is present in frame.
#
# Parameters values are in the sense: mean, MAP/ML, median, mode.
# Parameters uncertainties are: 16th, 84th percentiles, and STDDEV.
# z: Metallicity value.
# a: log(age).
# E: extinction E(B-V).
# d: Distance modulus.
# M: Total initial mass.
# b: Binary fraction.
# Nt: Number of samples used to estimate the parameters values.
#
# f1 The background value is smaller than a third of the maximum radial
#    density value.
# f2 Not enough points found stabilized around the background value -->
#    clust_rad was set to the middle value in the density profile.
# f3 The delta range around the background used to attain the stable
#    condition to determine the radius is greater than 10%%. This indicates
#    a possible variable background.
# f4 The process to fit a 3-P King profile to the density points did not
#    converge or did so to a tidal radius beyond the ranges of the frame.
# f5 The number of approximate structural cluster members ('n_memb') is <10.
# f6 The number of approximate structural and photometric cluster members
#    differ greatly --> abs(n_memb_par) > 0.33.
#
# FC (flags count): Sum of all the flags values. The bigger this value the
#    more likely it is that there's a problem with the frame, ie: no
#    cluster, more than one cluster present in the frame, variable or too
#    crowded field, etc.
